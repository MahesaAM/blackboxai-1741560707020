# Required Model Files

This directory should contain the following model files:

1. `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`  
   Download from: http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2  
   Extract the .bz2 file to get the .dat file

2. `face_recognition_model.xml`  
   This file is part of OpenCV's face detection models. You can find it in OpenCV's data directory or download it from OpenCV's GitHub repository.

Place both files in this directory before using the SDK.
